Platform-System Integration Planning
Reader must be evaluated against GoreeCloud Manager, Privacy Shield, Wardveil Security, Everkeep, Glaze UI, GoreeCloud Mesh, and GoreeCloud Identity. Where the product specification already names account/profile, privacy, Glaze UI, sync, permissions, or self-hosting behavior, those remain planned product requirements. Detailed integration mechanisms, enforcement points, recovery behavior, and implementation evidence remain to be defined and verified before any integration is represented as complete.
Lifecycle Rule
A roadmap item remains active until it is implemented and verified or receives an explicit authoritative lifecycle disposition such as cancellation, supersession, or confirmed non-applicability. Documentation changes alone do not complete a feature.
